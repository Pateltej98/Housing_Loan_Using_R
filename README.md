# Housing_Loan_Using_R
People approach banks to take loans to fulfil their needs accordingly. This practice has been increasing day by day across all sectors of the society such as education purposes, business purposes and predominantly for agriculture. But some people take this advantage of taking the loan and misuse that money for some other purposes and do not repay the amount back to the loan. There are high chances that the bank might lose its money in case if loan sanctioned to such customers. With technology developing very rapidly these days, data mining plays a key role to solve such issues. This Projects targets to predict and classify the customers who will be able to repay the money back to the bank. We use Classification task for the machine learning algorithms for predictive modelling in such scenarios.
